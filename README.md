# Titanic-Disaster-Survival-Prediction-Using-Logistic-Regression
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using logistic regression. The dataset used for this analysis is the famous Titanic dataset, which provides information on the passengers. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a passenger survived the disaster based on these features.
